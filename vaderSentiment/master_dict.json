As someone that used a 960 for a few months after my 7870XT died (caused by a bad PSU) it was a  nice card and served me well till I got my 480. I'm sure this card will do well. A few things though..\n\nIf the 1070 and 1080 are any indication then the 1060 partner cards will be just as expensive if not more than the founders. So it'll be 299 or higher making it at least 50-100+ bucks more than a 480.  Are they really even in the same bracket for comparison at this point? I just don't know if we should be pairing them as rivals. Thats a pretty hefty price difference at this level for a budget minded gamer that the 480 targets. If I was willing to buy at the 300-330 price point I would have got a 390 and not waited for the 480 due to sheer impatience. I'm glad I waited for other reasons but it was a major factor for me, a barrier so to say. \n\nFrom what I'm seeing in benchmarks so far, for most current or slightly older titles the 1060s raw power beats the 480. However DX12 the 480 is doing better for most titles, and   we know damn well that Vulkan games the 480 should do better.  Look at the boost Vulkan gave the 480 for DOOM. \n\nThen to consider the 1060 can't SLI while I can go get another 480, crossfire and be more on the heels of the 1080, when I decide the upgrade is warranted to do", "timestamp": "2016-07-19T13:51:36.000Z", "senti_score": 0.6919, "author": "Sequiro"}, "UgivkiM6xZRooHgCoAEC": {"senti_class": "neg", "text": "haha nvidia slowest card is faster than amds fastest card and uses less power\n\namd just gets shittier by the year.  zen will be a loser too, you can bet on that", "timestamp": "2016-07-20T04:52:04.000Z", "senti_score": -0.5423, "author": "Jayman"}, "Ugi-zFn6PuNkNHgCoAEC": {"senti_class": "neg", "text": "I can't wait for 480 from Sapphire!

When you ask a finger to do something that it is not strong enough to do, the OTHER fingers around it will do strange and unexpected things in an attempt to help the struggling finger. They will tense up or 'fly away' or perhaps your wrist will break or you'll drop a shoulder or hunch your back or tense up in some other way. This is why when you start working on a new piece you will sometimes find your fingers doing unexpected and bizarre things. Things you've never seen them do before. I think the problem is not with the finger(s) that are tense or flying away, but with some other finger which is too weak for what is required at that point in the piece. You can see this same kind of problem in all other physical activities (sports) where technique breaks down because of weakness. This is why all sports have strength and conditioning programs during the off season. They understand that strength is the foundation for good technique in any physical endeavor. Find your weakness, fix your weakness, and your technical problems will go away. The stronger you are the easier it is to relax. If you are weak you won't be able to relax. As you get stronger you will discover that it is easier to find your muscles and relax them and still play.", "timestamp": "2015-04-15T06:54:09.000Z", "senti_score": 0.8105, "author": "Don"}, "UgiRP-PxfnF8UHgCoAEC": {"senti_class": "pos", "text": "Very useful videos!
